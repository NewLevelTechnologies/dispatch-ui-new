# Work Order Detail Page — Design

Status: Draft for review
Owner: Paul Wilcox

This document captures the design decisions for the Work Order detail page — the most important page in the application. It is the operational hub where CSRs, dispatchers, and managers spend most of their day.

It is intentionally opinionated. Everything here is open to pushback, but each call has a stated reason so we can argue with the reason rather than the conclusion.

---

## 1. Why this page matters and the patterns it uses

The WO detail page is where the business actually runs:

- CSRs read/write internal notes to coordinate with dispatchers and techs.
- Dispatchers see who's assigned, when, and what's left to do.
- Office managers track quotes, invoices, payments, and POs against the job.
- Field-relevant data (equipment, files, photos) lives here.

If this page is slow, cluttered, or forces context-switching to other screens, the whole business slows down. Density and glanceability are non-negotiable.

### 1.1 Three-pattern rule

The page uses three UI patterns and three only. They do not overlap:

- **Main canvas** — the primary work surface (header + left strip + work items + activity rail). Always visible. Never hidden behind tabs.
- **Drawer** — slide-in panel from the right edge, used to *see more on a peripheral entity* without leaving the WO context. May contain internal tabs because it is itself a focused, intentional surface. Two surfaces use this pattern today: the financial detail drawer (§3.5, ~760–840px) and the equipment quickview drawer (~480px). Drawers can also stack — clicking a sub-unit chip inside the equipment drawer pushes onto the drawer's internal stack so the user can drill into nested components without losing the chain (one drawer is mounted at a time; the visible content swaps based on top-of-stack, with a back button labeled with the parent's name when stack > 1).
- **Dialog** — modal centered over the page, used for *create/edit forms*. Canonical Catalyst use.

If a future feature doesn't fit one of these three, that's a signal to question the feature, not to add a fourth pattern.

A drawer is a *context*; a dialog is an *action within a context*. They nest cleanly: clicking `+ New Invoice` inside the financials drawer opens a create dialog *over* the drawer, the drawer stays mounted underneath, and dialog close returns the user to the drawer (§3.5).

---

## 2. Data model decisions

These shape the UI; resolving them up front avoids painting ourselves into a corner.

### 2.1 Description belongs on the work item, not the WO

The current `WorkOrderFormDialog` has a `description` field on the WO. That field is really "first work item description" pretending to be WO metadata.

**Backend status (verified):**
- `WorkItem.description: String` already exists, NOT NULL (`work-order-service/.../entity/WorkItem.kt`).
- `WorkOrder.description: String?` is currently nullable on the WO entity.

**Decision:** Stop writing `WorkOrder.description`. Each work item already carries its own description. The WO describes *the engagement* (who, where, when, billing), not *the work*.

**Migration plan:**
1. UI stops sending `description` on WO create/update; WO create flow captures the first work item's description and creates both atomically.
2. Backfill: for any WO with `description != null` and no work items, create a single `WorkItem` from the WO's description, then null the WO field.
3. Drop the `description` column from `work_orders` once all writes have stopped.

### 2.2 Equipment is owned by the service location; work items reference it

Equipment is durable — the same condenser exists across many WOs over its lifetime.

**Decision:**
- `Equipment` is owned by `ServiceLocation`.
- `WorkItem` has a nullable `equipmentId` reference (work items don't always involve equipment — broader-than-HVAC industries may not have any).
- Equipment Profile pages (future) show full service history across every WO ever performed on a unit. We don't need to build that view now, but the data model supports it for free.

### 2.3 Financials (Invoice / Quote / PO) live at the WO level

We considered tying invoices to work items but rejected it:

- Real billing doesn't respect work-item boundaries — progress invoices, deposit + final, change orders span multiple work items or split one over time.
- One invoice combining multiple work items is a normal customer expectation.
- Same logic applies to POs and Quotes — keep them at WO level for consistency.

**Decision:** `Invoice`, `Quote`, `PurchaseOrder`, `Payment` all reference `WorkOrder`, not `WorkItem`. A WO can have many of each.

**Future-proofing (do not build now):** give `InvoiceLineItem` a nullable `workItemId` reference. Header stays at WO; lines can *optionally* point to the work item they billed for. Enables per-work-item profitability reporting later without forcing it on anyone today. Additive schema change, ship if/when needed.

### 2.4 No industry-specific fields on the core schema

Dispatch must serve broader-than-HVAC. Filter sizes, refrigerant, breaker size, tonnage, etc. are HVAC artifacts.

**Decision:** core `WorkOrder`, `WorkItem`, and `ServiceLocation` schemas stay industry-agnostic. Industry-specific data lives on:

- Equipment-type-specific custom fields (when we build equipment custom fields).
- Service-location custom fields (e.g., gate codes, after-hours contact).

The legacy "filter sizes" header chip was *generated* by scanning equipment at the location. We can revisit that pattern when we go deep on equipment, not now.

### 2.5 WO-level status rolls up from work item status categories

Each tenant-defined `WorkItemStatus` maps to a fixed `ProgressCategory` enum: `NOT_STARTED | IN_PROGRESS | COMPLETED | BLOCKED | CANCELLED`. The WO's overall status (the header pill) is derived from its work items' categories — no separate WO-status field needed, no per-tenant rollup rules to design.

Rollup precedence is already implemented in `WorkOrder.recalculateProgress()` (`work-order-service/.../entity/WorkOrder.kt`):

- empty → `NOT_STARTED`
- all `COMPLETED` → `COMPLETED`
- all `CANCELLED` → `CANCELLED`
- any `BLOCKED` → `BLOCKED`
- any `IN_PROGRESS` → `IN_PROGRESS`
- else → `NOT_STARTED`

`WorkOrder.progressCategory` is a cached/denormalized field, not a source of truth.

### 2.6 Work items do not carry pricing

The `WorkItem` entity currently has `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `totalPrice` (auto-computed via `@PrePersist`/`@PreUpdate`). This was a misunderstanding when the app was scaffolded.

**Decision:** Pricing belongs on **invoices and quotes**, not on work items. The clean separation is:

- **Work item** = operational record. *What was done* — description, status, equipment ref, type.
- **Invoice / Quote** = financial record. *What was billed* — line items with their own prices, taxes, discounts.

**Why:**

- Real trades pricing is messier than 1:1 to operational scope: markups, discounts, package deals, T&M vs flat-rate, change orders, customer-specific rate sheets, taxes/fees that aren't tied to any work item.
- A quote line might bundle three work items into "system replacement"; an invoice line might split one work item across two billing periods. Forcing the work item to be the pricing unit fights real billing.
- If `WorkItem.totalPrice` exists *and* invoice line totals exist, they will drift and reports will disagree.
- Per-work-item profitability is preserved through the optional `InvoiceLineItem.workItemId` bridge in §2.3 — no need to duplicate price state on the work item itself.

**What this changes:**

- Drop `quantity`, `unitPrice`, `totalPrice` from `WorkItem` entity.
- Drop the `@PrePersist`/`@PreUpdate` price computation.
- Schema migration to drop those columns from `work_items`.
- Drop the `WorkItemType` enum entirely (`LABOR | PARTS | SERVICE | OTHER`) — its sole purpose was pricing/billing categorization; with pricing gone, the enum has no remaining role. Drop the column from `work_items` and remove the enum class.
- `WorkItemServiceTest` and any service code referencing those fields gets simpler.

## 3. Layout

Desktop-first (≥1280px effective width). Two columns + sticky header. Peripheral entities (financials) live in a slide-in drawer triggered from clickable header chips. No tabs in the main canvas. No bottom strip.

  Click any header money chip → Financial detail drawer slides in from right
  (~760–840px wide; tabs: POs · Quotes · Invoices · Payments;
   create dialogs open over the drawer, drawer stays mounted underneath)
```

### 3.1 Sticky header (~110px, three rows + action bar)

**Revised 2026-05-08:** the action bar is removed; `+` affordances move to where their data lives (see §5d). Header keeps only `[Edit WO ▾]` + overflow `[⋯]` clustered at the right edge of row 1. Effective row count drops from "3 rows + action bar" to ~2 rows of metadata.

Always visible while scrolling.

- **Row 1 — Identity & state:** `WO #1234` · clickable status pill (current overall progress category; click → dropdown of allowed transitions per workflow rules) · `last touched 14m ago by Jamie`
- **Row 2 — Contact & schedule:** Customer name (linked) · click-to-contact phone · click-to-copy address · primary ETA
  - **Click-to-contact phone behavior is viewport-dependent.** On desktop (≥1024px), clicking the phone copies the number to the clipboard and shows a toast — most CSRs use a separate softphone (RingCentral, Dialpad, etc.) and `tel:` would do nothing useful. On tablet/mobile, the same control uses `tel:`. Detection by viewport width, not user agent.
- **Row 3 — Money summary chips:** `$ quoted · $ invoiced · $ paid · NTE · Balance`
  - Each segment is a clickable chip that opens the Financial detail drawer (§3.5) directly to the matching tab.
  - **Zero-value chips remain clickable.** `$0 paid` opens the Payments tab to an empty state. Consistency over special-casing.
- ~~**Action bar:** `+ Work Item` · `+ Dispatch` · `+ Note` · `Edit WO ▾` · overflow `⋯` (Delete, Print, Duplicate, Convert to Recurring).~~ <br/> **Revised 2026-05-08:** action bar removed. Only `[Edit WO ▾]` + overflow `[⋯]` (Delete, Print, Duplicate, Convert to Recurring) remain, clustered at the right edge of header row 1. `+ Work Item` / `+ Dispatch` / `+ Note` redistribute to their natural homes per §5d. The earlier "compose button in both places" rationale is moot once the always-on composer is gone.

### 3.2 Left strip (~240px, collapsible)

Compact `DescriptionList` cards stacked vertically:

- **Service Location** — address, contact, link to location page, location-level notes / custom fields (when those exist).
- **Order Info** — order date, customer order #, division, type, NTE, priority.
- **Billing** — only render when billing differs from service location.

Collapses to icons (and expands on click) below 1280px (see §3.7).

### 3.3 Main canvas — Work Items

Dense Catalyst `Table` of work items with click-to-expand rows. **No tabs in this region. No financials strip below it.**

- **Columns:** chevron (expand toggle) · status pill (inline-editable) · description (inline-editable) · `⋯` per-row menu. *No "Last Updated" column* — it duplicated the WO header / activity rail timestamps and burned width that description needs more; the value lives in the muted footer at the bottom of the expansion now.
- **Collapsed row content:** chevron + status pill + description text (which wraps) + a 32px equipment thumbnail (left of the description) when an equipment is linked. The equipment thumbnail is a CSR scan-id aid — without it the table reads as a wall of text. *(Earlier drafts of this doc forbade thumbnails; the live page reverses that call. See §4.)*
- **Expanded row** is a sectioned detail block with subtle muted bg signaling "detail of the row above":
  - **EQUIPMENT block** — first-class inline-edit surface, not a read-only summary. Most equipment writes happen in WO context, so the expansion treats equipment as an edit target.
    - Section header: `EQUIPMENT` label + `[✎ Edit all]` + `[↗ Open page]` actions.
    - Identity row: 48px thumbnail + equipment name + status pill (lime/zinc, inline-editable with confirm-on-RETIRED) + type · category subline.
    - 2-col inline-edit grid: Make / Model · Serial / Location-on-Site · (Asset Tag when projected on the summary).
    - Sub-units chip row when descendants exist: `Sub-units (3): [Compressor →] [Coil →] [Fan →]`. Each chip links to that sub-unit's detail page.
    - Empty state when no equipment linked: section header + `+ Add Equipment` action that opens `EquipmentFormDialog` in CREATE mode with the WO's service location pre-locked. On save the new equipment auto-links to the work item via `EquipmentFormDialog.onCreated`.
  - **PHOTOS sub-section** (nested under Equipment, not a peer): row of thumbnails + count + `[Manage →]` link. Hides when empty. Sourced from existing `equipmentImagesApi`.
  - **EQUIPMENT NOTES sub-section** (nested, persistent service knowledge — *not* WO-scoped notes): muted helper text *"Saved with this equipment, not this work order"* under the heading so CSRs from legacy don't confuse this with WO conversation. Always renders with a `+ Add note` affordance even when empty (encourages capture). Needs a new `equipment_notes` sub-resource on the backend.
  - **LINKED block** (peer-level, *outside* Equipment): chips for any Quote / Invoice / PO that references this work item. Driven by the optional `InvoiceLineItem.workItemId` from §2.3. Clicking a chip opens the financial detail drawer to that record.
  - **Footer line** (outside any block): muted italic *"Updated 2d ago by Jamie"* — this is the work item's `updatedAt`, not the equipment's. Putting it inside Equipment would conflate two entities.
- **Default expansion state:** all rows collapsed. Multiple rows may be expanded simultaneously (CSRs comparing two items). State is in-memory; resets on navigation.
- **Inline editing:** status pill (dropdown of allowed transitions per workflow), description (click-to-edit textarea), every visible equipment field in the expansion (click-to-edit text via `EditableField`). Per-row delete via `⋯`. `readOnly` (cancelled/archived WO) suppresses Edit / Add / Delete.

**Equipment is multi-audience on this page; do not collapse it to a chip.** Even after the future tech mobile app ships, equipment info on the WO page serves four audiences routinely: CSRs (call disambiguation — "is this the AC or the heater you're calling about?"), dispatchers (skill-match for assignment — Daniel HVAC vs Jason general; commercial 5-ton vs residential split), sales (quoting / scoping replacements), and techs as a desktop fallback. "Collapse equipment to a chevron chip with full block on demand" was floated 2026-05-08 and rejected — it would force four audiences to click for data they all use routinely. Visual-weight concerns about the equipment block dominating the page are usually downstream of *other* sections being missing or placeholder (dispatch unbuilt, money chips hidden, oversized action bar). Fix those first per §5d, then re-evaluate equipment hierarchy at the §5e stand-back review — not before.

### 3.4 Right rail (~360px)

**Revised 2026-05-08:** this section is obsolete. The right rail is removed entirely. Activity stream + inline note composer move into a slide-in drawer (~440–520px) triggered by an `Activity ●` button on the page; see §5d for the new spec. Active Dispatches surface placement is deferred to the phase 6 design pass — no longer pinned to the (deleted) rail. The original spec below is preserved as historical context only.

Two stacked sections, both serving the "what's happening on this WO" question:

- **Pinned Active Dispatches widget** at the top — only renders when at least one dispatch is scheduled or in-progress within the next ~24h. Vertical list of compact dispatch cards: tech name, ETA, current dispatch status, primary action button (e.g. Check Out). Solves the dispatcher's at-a-glance need without dedicating a column to dispatches.
- **Activity stream** below the widget. Merged feed of:
  - Notes added by users.
  - Dispatch lifecycle events (assigned, departed, arrived, checked out).
  - Work item / WO status changes.
  - Financial events (quote sent, invoice issued, payment received).
- **Filter chips at top of stream:** `All · Notes · Dispatches · Status · $`.
- **Inline `+ note` composer** above the stream — text area + Save. No modal.
- **Pagination:** virtualized infinite scroll. Newest first; older events load as the rail scrolls. Long-tail WOs (months open) accumulate hundreds of events; load-all is not viable.

### 3.5 Financial detail drawer

Opens from any header money chip (§3.1, Row 3) or from a linked-entity chip on an expanded work-item row (§3.3). Slides in from the right edge, **~760–840px wide** (financial tables need width to breathe; narrower drawers cramp them).

- **Internal tabs: POs · Quotes · Invoices · Payments.** Full-width tables inside the drawer. Tabs are acceptable here only because the drawer is itself a focused, intentional surface — the §1.1 three-pattern rule explicitly carves out internal-tab usage *inside* a drawer.
- Active tab is determined by which chip the user clicked (e.g., header `$ invoiced` → Invoices tab; header `Bal $X` → Invoices tab filtered to unpaid).
- **Drawer-over-drawer / dialog-over-drawer rule:** clicking `+ New Invoice` (or any create action) inside the drawer opens a create **dialog** *over* the drawer. The drawer stays mounted underneath (visually dimmed). On dialog close, the drawer is the context the user returns to. The drawer is a *context*; the dialog is an *action within that context*. This is consistent with §1.1.
- **Closing the drawer:** click outside the drawer, click the close affordance, or press `Esc` (§3.6).

### 3.6 Inline editing and keyboard shortcuts

CSRs are half-keyboard. Inline edits and shortcuts are not optional polish — they're the primary path. Treat both as first-class.

**Inline edit affordances:**

- **Status pills** (header + per work item row): click → dropdown of allowed transitions per workflow rules. The single most-used inline op; ships in phase 2.
- **Description / NTE / type / division / priority** in header and left strip: click → inline input, save on blur or Enter, revert on Esc.
- **Work item description** on each row: click → inline input. Status edits via the pill.
- **Notes:** composer at top of activity stream. No modal.

**Keyboard shortcuts** (active when the page has focus and no input is focused):

- `N` — open activity drawer with composer autofocused (§5d). *Previously: focus inline composer in right rail — obsolete since the rail was removed.*
- `W` — open `+ Work Item` dialog.
- `D` — open `+ Dispatch` dialog.
- `E` — open `Edit WO` dialog.
- `/` — focus activity-stream filter.
- `Esc` — close drawer or dialog (whichever is topmost; if neither, blur the focused input).

Shortcuts ship incrementally with the surfaces they target — see §5.

### 3.7 Responsive behavior below 1280px

The two-column layout assumes ≥1280px effective width. Below that:

- **Left strip** collapses to a row of icons under the header that expand into the existing card content on click.
- **Right rail** becomes a **bottom sheet** triggered by an "Activity" button in the header action bar. The bottom sheet is the activity rail (with its pinned Active Dispatches widget), full-width, sliding up from the bottom edge. Closing returns to the main canvas.
- **Main canvas** (work items) takes the full width.
- **Financial detail drawer** still slides in but takes ~90% of the viewport on small screens.

1366×768 laptops (the realistic CSR floor) clear the 1280px bar with the left strip collapsed by default.

### 3.8 Custom components (everything else maps to Catalyst)

Two custom components were planned. Status:

1. **`ExpandableTableRow`** — *not extracted as a standalone component.* The expansion logic is currently inlined in `WorkItemsTable` (single consumer; extracting prematurely was YAGNI). Extract when a second consumer earns it. Pattern: track an expanded `Set<string>` of row ids in component state, render a chevron toggle in a leftmost cell, and emit a second `<TableRow>` with `colSpan` carrying the detail content when expanded.
2. **`EditableField`** — *shipped.* Generic click-to-edit field swapper. Renders a value as text; on click swaps to an input; saves on blur or Enter; reverts on Esc. Wraps text, textarea, and select. Used everywhere inline editing is wired up (§3.6, the equipment block in §3.3, the left strip on the WO page, and the equipment detail page).

Everything else — header layout, `DescriptionList`, money chips, action bar, drawer, dialogs, status pills, badges, dropdowns, table, filter chips, activity-stream rows — maps directly to Catalyst primitives or Headless UI components Catalyst already wraps.

## 4. What we're cutting (legacy + earlier drafts of this doc)

| Element | Cut because | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| **Bottom strip with summary cards** (earlier draft of this doc) | Pushes financials below the fold on dense WOs; introduces a third drill-in pattern (inline-card-grows-into-table) that conflicts with §1.1 | Header money chips → financial detail drawer (§3.5) |
| **`History` tab** (proposed in critique) | Activity stream *is* the history | Activity rail (§3.4) |
| **Three-column layout** (earlier draft) | Wastes ~340px when dispatches are quiet; legacy 2010s admin DNA | Two columns + activity rail (§3.3, §3.4) |
| **Vertical work-item cards** (earlier draft) | 2–3 items per screen; CSRs need scan, not stack of mini-dashboards | Dense expandable Catalyst Table (§3.3) |
| ~~**Equipment thumbnails in work item rows**~~ | ~~CSR doesn't need photos; tech/manager surface~~ | ~~Model/serial as text; thumbnails on equipment profile page (later)~~ <br/> **Reversed 2026-05-04:** the live page shows a 32px thumbnail in collapsed rows (visual scan id) and a 48px thumbnail in the expansion (anchors the equipment block). CSRs *do* scan visually; the original anti-thumbnail call overcorrected against legacy. |
| **Files thumbnail grid in work item rows** | CSR cares about "are there files?" + recency | Count + last-added timestamp |
| **Maintenance Reports as a parallel entity** | A maintenance report is a *kind* of work item, not a separate thing | Work item template |
| **Separate `Add PM Inspection` / `Add HVAC Inspection` / `Add Maintenance Report` buttons** (legacy) | Button clutter; not extensible across industries | One `+ Work Item` button → choose template |
| **"System Activities" workflow tasks** (Request Quote, Request PO, Follow Up, etc.) (legacy) | Conflates WO with task management | Future task/workflow system, separate design, only if there's real demand |
| **Schedule M–F hours block in legacy header** | Site-level data | Service location page; link from left strip |
| **Per-work-item full PO/Quote/Invoice tables in card body** (legacy + earlier draft) | Duplicates the drawer; clutters work-item rows | Linked-entity chips in expanded row + drawer for detail |
| **`Tech` tab in legacy Site/Docs/Tech/Info widget** | Less glanceable than a persistent surface | Pinned Active Dispatches widget (§3.4) |
| **Site/Docs/Tech/Info tabbed widget** (legacy) | Tabs hide data | Inline left strip + activity rail |
| **`Rates` block in right rail** (earlier draft) | Site-level data | Service location page |

## 5. Build order (phased, each step shippable)

Each phase produces a working page that's better than the previous. We don't ship a page that requires phase 7 to be useful. The activity rail lands early because it's the highest-value surface; inline status edit lands in phase 2 because without it phase 2 is a placeholder, not a useful page.

**Status as of 2026-05-04:** phases 1–5 shipped. Row expansion v2 shipped (with equipment as a first-class inline-edit surface, see §5a below). Phase 6 (Dispatch) and phase 7 (Financial drawer) not started. Several action-bar buttons (Edit WO, Print, Duplicate, Delete) still render disabled placeholders pending follow-up work.

1. **Page skeleton** — sticky header (3 rows + action bar; click-to-copy phone behavior, money chips render values but the drawer doesn't exist yet so chip clicks no-op) + left strip with `DescriptionList` cards (Service Location, Order Info, Billing-if-different). Reachable from the WO list at `/work-orders/:id`. Header status pill renders read-only. ✅ shipped
2. **Work items dense table + inline status pill edit.** Catalyst `Table` rendered into the main canvas. Columns: status pill (inline-editable), description, last updated. **Inline status pill edits** wire up here on the header pill and on each row — smallest, highest-frequency inline op, makes phase 2 ship as a useful page rather than a placeholder. Empty state: "No work items on this work order." ✅ shipped (Last Updated column subsequently dropped — moved into the row-expansion footer per §5a)
3. **Activity stream + pinned Active Dispatches widget + functional note composer** in the right rail. Merged feed (dispatches, status changes, notes, financial events) sourced from a new aggregating endpoint. Inline `+ note` composer at the top of the rail is **functional** (writes via `POST /work-orders/{id}/notes` against the new notes sub-resource). Pagination/virtualization in place from day one. `N` keyboard shortcut wires up here. **Responsive bottom-sheet behavior (§3.7) also ships here** — the activity rail is the first piece that wouldn't fit on a 1280px laptop; the bottom-sheet pattern needs to exist before users hit the wall. ✅ shipped

   *Note creation lives here, not in phase 5, because the composer pattern (empty textarea + Save) is structurally different from `EditableField`'s click-swap-on-existing-value pattern. Bundling them just because both are write surfaces is a weak grouping when no implementation is shared.*

4. **Work item create/edit dialog + `WorkOrder.description` → `WorkItem.description` migration.** Focused dialog with description, type, status, equipment typeahead (mirror `ServiceLocationPicker` pattern). WO create flow gains a "First work item description" field that creates WO + first work item atomically (or two sequential calls if the atomic-create endpoint in §7 is not yet resolved). The `WorkOrderFormDialog`'s `internalNotes` field is also removed here (notes are now a sub-resource — initial note creation, if any, is a separate `POST /work-orders/{id}/notes` call after the WO is created). `W` keyboard shortcut wires up here. ✅ shipped
5. **Inline edits on existing fields.** Click-to-edit for description / NTE / type / division / priority / work item description — `EditableField` custom component (§3.8) built here, then reused. `/` keyboard shortcut wires up here. *Note creation moved to phase 3 — phase 5 owns the click-to-edit-existing-value pattern only.* ✅ shipped (NTE inline edit waits on backend `WorkOrder.notToExceed` field — not blocking)
6. **Dispatch create flow + Active Dispatches surface.** `+ Dispatch` opens create dialog; surface primary actions (Check Out, etc.) wired up. `D` keyboard shortcut wires up here. **Design pass before code:** stress-test against within-WO ugly cases — reassignment chains (cancel → reassign → revisit), no-shows, multi-day repairs, disputed arrival timestamps. Cross-WO scheduling is *not* this page's job (§8). Surface placement (header strip vs sidebar vs other) is part of the design pass; the §3.4 "pinned to right rail" call is obsolete per §5d. ⏳ not started — `dispatchApi.create` already exists, no backend dependency.
7. **Financial detail drawer.** Header money chips become live; linked-entity chips on work-item rows become live. Drawer with `POs · Quotes · Invoices · Payments` internal tabs. Create dialogs open over the drawer per §3.5. `Esc` close-topmost shortcut formalized here (it can land earlier with whatever first introduces a drawer or dialog; phase 7 just makes it the canonical close behavior across all surfaces). ⏳ not started — biggest remaining surface; warrants a dedicated scoping pass before code (invoice/quote/PO/payment create-form designs in particular). Money chip row currently hidden on the page until phase 7 starts populating real values.

Each phase ships behind the same route — `/work-orders/:id` is wired up at phase 1 and progressively gains capability.

### 5a. Phase 5b — Work-item row expansion (shipped 2026-05-04)

Inserted between phase 5 and phase 6 once equipment FK on `WorkItem` shipped on the backend. Treats the expanded equipment block as a first-class edit surface, not a read-only summary, because most equipment writes happen in WO context.

What shipped:

- `ExpandableTableRow`-style toggle on each row (chevron at the leftmost column, rotates 90° on expand). Multiple rows can be expanded simultaneously. State is in-memory; resets on navigation.
- 32px equipment thumbnail in the collapsed row's description cell (visual scan id).
- Last Updated column dropped from the table; the value moved to a muted italic footer at the bottom of the expanded row, **outside the equipment block** (it's the work item's `updatedAt`, not the equipment's — nesting it inside EQUIPMENT conflated entities).
- Equipment block in the expansion: section label + actions (`Edit all`, `Open page`) + 48px thumbnail + name + type/category subline + 2-col inline-edit grid (Make / Model · Serial / Location-on-Site).
- `Edit all` opens `EquipmentFormDialog` for fields not in the visible grid (description, install date, warranty, etc.).
- `Open page` links to the full equipment detail page (Photos, Filters, Service History, Components tabs).
- Inline edits on every visible equipment field call `equipmentApi.update` and invalidate equipment + both work-order query prefixes (`['work-orders']`, `['work-orders-list']`) so the row, list views, and Equipment Service History all refresh in lockstep.
- Empty state when no equipment is linked: section header + `+ Add Equipment` action that opens `EquipmentFormDialog` in CREATE mode with the WO's service location pre-locked. On create, the new equipment is automatically linked to the work item via `EquipmentFormDialog.onCreated`.
- `readOnly` mode (cancelled/archived WO) renders fields as static text and suppresses Edit / Add / Delete actions.
- Money chip row (header row 3) hidden until phase 7 (a row of `$ —` placeholders communicates nothing on a fresh WO and burns vertical real estate).

**Subsequently shipped (2026-05-05):**

- ✅ **Status pill** — but trimmed: renders only when equipment is RETIRED (amber). Common-case ACTIVE shows nothing, retired stands out. One-click un-retire via the pill; ACTIVE → RETIRED routes through "Edit all" (intentional friction for the destructive transition).
- ✅ **Asset tag** initially shipped, then dropped — it's a tech/scanner field, not a CSR scan field, and didn't earn the inline real estate. Lives behind "Edit all" alongside install date and warranty.
- ✅ **Sub-unit chips** with `descendantCount` truncation indicator and per-chip thumbnails. Click a chip to open the equipment quickview drawer (§3.5b). `+ Add unit` chip at the end of the row opens `EquipmentFormDialog` with the parent equipment locked.

What's deferred — slot in as their backends ship, no redesign needed:

- **Equipment Photos sub-section** (nested inside the Equipment block, not a peer). Use existing `equipmentImagesApi` lazy-loaded on row expansion, OR project `recentPhotos[]` onto `WorkItemEquipmentSummary` to avoid the N+1. Hides when empty.
- **Equipment Notes sub-section** (also nested, with helper text "Saved with this equipment, not this work order" so CSRs don't write WO-scoped content here). Always renders with `+ Add note` even when empty. **Needs new backend sub-resource: `POST/GET/DELETE /equipment/{id}/notes`** with body, author, timestamp. Same shape as legacy "Internal Notes."
- **Linked-entity chips** (Quote/Invoice/PO chips on work item rows). Needs the optional `InvoiceLineItem.workItemId` from §2.3 — build only when per-work-item profitability reporting earns it.

### 5b. Equipment quickview drawer (shipped 2026-05-05)

Slide-over drawer (~480px) opened from a sub-unit chip click in the work-item row's equipment block. Lets CSRs inspect AND edit a sub-unit without leaving the WO context — sub-unit creates and edits both happen ~100% in WO context per actual CSR workflow, so the drawer is a first-class edit surface, not a read-only peek.

What shipped:

- 64px hero thumbnail + name (inline-editable) + status pill (lime/amber, ACTIVE/RETIRED, inline-editable both ways in this context) + type/category subline.
- Identification block: name, make, model, serial, asset tag, location-on-site — all inline-editable via `EditableField`. Cache invalidation hits `['equipment']`, `['equipment-detail', id]`, `['equipment-descendants']`, `['work-orders']`, `['work-orders-list']` — same triple-key pattern as the row's primary equipment block.
- Lifecycle block: install date, last serviced (read-only, backend-managed), warranty expires, warranty details — inline-editable.
- Sub-units chip row inside the drawer (no `+ Add` — see depth restriction below). Clicking a sub-unit chip pushes onto the drawer's internal stack (drawer-over-drawer recursion). Back button at the top of the header is labeled with the parent name when the stack is more than one deep ("← Back to {parentName}"); at the root it's a plain X close. The chip row hides entirely when there are no existing sub-units to display (avoids an orphaned "(0):" label).
- "Open full page" link at the footer routes to the dedicated `/equipment/{id}` for the full surface (Photos, Filters, Service History, Components tabs).
- `+ Add unit` ONLY in the work-item row's primary equipment chip row — opens `EquipmentFormDialog` with `lockedParent` set; the new sub-unit's `parentId` is set on create and it inherits the parent's `serviceLocationId` implicitly. Not exposed inside the drawer because the drawer always views a sub-unit (depth 1+), and the product rule restricts the equipment hierarchy to 2 levels deep — adding from inside the drawer would create depth-2 records.

Architecturally only ONE `SlideOver` is mounted at a time — content swaps based on top-of-stack rather than physically stacking dialogs. Visually the UX is identical and state stays simple.

Backend asks resolved:

- ✅ `descendants[]` and `descendantCount` projected on the `Equipment` response from `GET /equipment/{id}?includeDescendants=true`. Opt-in via the query param so default callers (EquipmentDetailPage et al.) stay lean. Drawer passes the option; the parallel `equipmentApi.getDescendants` query was dropped.
- ✅ `profileImageUrl` on `descendants[]` entries everywhere — sub-unit chips render their 20px thumbnails directly off the projected URL.

### 5c. Open follow-ups across the page

Independent of the phase ordering — each is a small, separate branch.

- **Edit WO button** in the header action bar (currently disabled). Wires `onClick` to open the existing `WorkOrderFormDialog`. One-line change once the dialog is verified to still match the page's data shape.
- **Overflow menu** on the header (Print, Duplicate, Delete). All three currently render disabled; each needs its own scoping pass — Delete is the smallest (confirm + `workOrderApi.delete` + navigate back).
- **NTE field** in left strip + header chip. Backend doesn't have `WorkOrder.notToExceed` yet; add it as a small backend ask alongside the financial drawer scoping (phase 7 reads from it).
- **Money chip row reveal logic**: when phase 7 ships and chips have real values, reveal the row when at least one chip has a non-zero value; keep hidden on fresh WOs.

### 5d. Page reshape (planned 2026-05-08)

Set of cheap, independent wins to ship before phase 6/7. Bundled here so they land together but they're individually deployable on separate branches — none depend on each other or on phase 6/7 backend work.

**Why now:** the page's information hierarchy is currently distorted by missing pieces — phase 6 (dispatches) is unbuilt, phase 7 (money chips) is hidden, and the action bar is oversized placeholder. Three things look wrong as a result: the action bar dominates with three CTAs that should live next to their data; the right rail's always-on activity feed and note composer eat premium real estate for what are reference and low-frequency-write surfaces respectively; and the equipment block looks visually heavy mostly because everything around it is empty. Fix the cheap things now. Defer the equipment hierarchy question (and any other "is this section the right size" question) until after phase 6 + 7 land — at that point the page weighs its real weight and §5e covers the holistic re-look.

**What ships:**

- **Action bar removed** (§3.1). Three big buttons go away. Only `[Edit WO ▾]` + overflow `[⋯]` remain, clustered at the right edge of header row 1.
- **`+` affordances redistribute contextually.** `+ Work Item` at the top of the work items table. `+ Dispatch` in the active dispatches surface (lands with phase 6). `+ Note` inside the activity drawer (see below). Discoverability is preserved because contextual placement *is* the discoverability — `+ Work Item` next to the work item table is more findable than `+ Work Item` in a generic top bar.
- **Right rail removed** (§3.4). Activity stream + inline note composer both move into a slide-in drawer (~440–520px wide; text-heavy, doesn't need financial-drawer width). Triggered by an `Activity ●` button on the page — dot signals unread since last open. **No count.** Total counts grow forever and stop meaning anything; notes-only counts are arbitrary. The dot also avoids the "47 events, deal with later" psychology.
- **Composer lives inside the drawer**, top-of-stack above the stream. One drawer, one entry point, opens for both reading and writing. Replaces the design's earlier "composer in two places" rationale.
- **Label is `Activity`, not `History`.** Present-tense framing for a live work order; `History` reads as audit/forensic.
- **Empty-state for the drawer:** composer carries it. Autofocus on open, useful placeholder ("Note for the team about WO-XXXX..."), generous height, single "WO created" event quietly underneath. No "0 events" header above the stream.
- **`N` keyboard shortcut** opens the drawer with composer autofocused (§3.6). Same muscle memory, different surface.
- **Active Dispatches surface placement is *not* settled here.** It's no longer pinned to the (deleted) right rail; the actual call (header strip vs sidebar vs other) is part of the phase 6 design pass — see phase 6 entry above.

**Three-pattern rule (§1.1) is preserved.** The activity drawer is canonical drawer use; nothing else changes.

**Doc bookkeeping:** §3.1, §3.3, §3.4, §3.6, §8 carry inline revision notes pointing here. Phase 6 (§5) is updated to reflect that dispatches no longer ship into a deleted right rail.

### 5e. Stand-back review (planned, post-phase-7)

Deliberate full-page review once phase 6 (dispatches), phase 7 (financial drawer / money chips), and §5d (page reshape) have all shipped. The visual hierarchy can only be honestly assessed when the page is actually populated; small adjustments along the way risk ending up with a page that's the sum of local decisions rather than a coherent whole.

**Format:**

- Real CSR or dispatcher in the room. Not a designer self-review. Designers find layout problems; users find workflow problems — different bug classes.
- Real-shaped data: spin up a tenant with ~50 WOs across the lifecycle (fresh, mid-flight, escalated, completed, cancelled, multi-dispatch, no-equipment, equipment-heavy). Watch the user navigate them.

**What's deferred to this review:**

- Whether the equipment block (currently dominant in the work-item expansion) needs to shrink. Equipment is multi-audience (§3.3) — collapse-to-chip is rejected up front. The open question is sizing within the expansion, not whether it lives there.
- Whether the left strip's content composition is right.
- Whether the header weight is balanced once money chips populate.
- Whether the Active Dispatches surface placement chosen in phase 6 still feels right with everything else populated.

Don't make these calls before the review. The right answer depends on the populated page, not a half-built one.

## 6. UI / component conventions

- **Catalyst UI** components throughout (per CLAUDE.md). No custom HTML/Tailwind that duplicates Catalyst.
- **Dense layout** — `dense` table prop, compact spacing per `CSR_PATTERNS.md`.
- **Glossary** — every entity reference goes through `getName()` per `GLOSSARY_INTEGRATION.md`. Entity codes used: `work_order`, `work_item` (new — needs adding), `service_location`, `customer`, `equipment`, `invoice`, `quote`, `payment`, `dispatch`.
- **i18n** — parameterized `common.*` keys with `getName()`, alphabetically sorted.
- **React Query** — fetch WO + relations in a single page-level query if API supports it; otherwise parallel queries with shared loading state.

## 7. Open questions / deferred decisions

These do not block phase 1. Calling them out so we know they exist.

1. **Work item templates** — tenant-configurable presets that pre-fill description, default status, etc. for common cases like "PM Inspection," "HVAC Inspection," "Maintenance Report." Same `taxonomy` shape as `WorkOrderType`. Useful but not phase-1.
2. **Drag-to-reorder work items.** Worth it now, or only when WOs routinely have 3+ items? Cheap to add later if not in phase 2.
3. **Per-work-item profitability reporting** — depends on the future `InvoiceLineItem.workItemId`. Document the schema option but don't build the report.
4. **Customer-facing technician portal / customer view of the WO.** Out of scope for this page; that's a separate read-only render.
5. **Backend additions required before work-item row expansion ships.** *(Mostly resolved — see below for what's left.)*

   - ✅ Equipment FK on `WorkItem` — shipped.
   - ✅ `WorkItemEquipmentSummary` projects `status`, `assetTag`, `parentName`, `descendants[]`, `descendantCount`, `profileImageUrl` — shipped (UI follow-up to wire status pill / asset tag / sub-units pending).
   - ✅ `PATCH /work-orders/{woId}/work-items/{wiId}` accepts truly partial bodies (e.g. `{ equipmentId: "..." }` alone) — fixed 2026-05-04.
   - ⏳ **Per-equipment internal notes** — new sub-resource needed: `POST /equipment/{id}/notes`, `GET /equipment/{id}/notes`, `DELETE /equipment/{id}/notes/{noteId}`. Body, author, timestamp. Same shape as legacy "Internal Notes." *Equipment-scoped per the realization that legacy "Notes" were equipment-attached service knowledge, not WO-scoped — see §5a above.*
   - ⏳ **Files / attachments** — *no longer needed.* Realized that legacy "Files" were ~95% equipment photos; the existing `equipmentImagesApi` covers it. No parallel WI-files entity to build.
   - ⏳ `InvoiceLineItem.workItemId` (optional future-proofing called out in §2.3; build only when per-work-item profitability reporting earns it).

**Resolved (formerly open):**

- *Audit log / activity feed* — addressed by the activity stream in §3.4. The merged feed (notes · dispatch events · status changes · financial events) *is* the audit log surface; no separate UI needed.
- *`WorkItemType` enum re-evaluation* — decided: drop the enum entirely. Captured in §2.6.
- *Atomic WO + first-work-item create endpoint* — backend change shipped.
- *Equipment FK on `WorkItem`* — shipped, see above.
- *Per-WI notes vs. equipment-scoped notes* — decided: equipment-scoped. Per-WI notes were never built and shouldn't be; activity rail covers WO-scoped conversation, equipment notes (when shipped) cover persistent service knowledge.
- *Per-WI files* — decided: don't build. Use equipment photos.

---

## 8. Non-goals

- Customer-facing views. This page is internal.
- Mobile field tech UI. Techs need a different, simpler view; out of scope here.
- Replacement for the dispatch board. The dispatch board is its own page; this page references dispatches but doesn't manage scheduling at scale. **Specifically out of scope:** cross-WO scheduling decisions (e.g., "is Tech A free at 4pm given his other jobs"). Those belong on the dispatch board. The WO page surfaces dispatches *for this WO only* and resists scope creep that would absorb cross-WO concerns. When the phase 6 dispatch surface is designed (§5), stress-test against within-WO ugly cases — reassignment chains, no-shows, multi-day repairs, disputed timestamps — not cross-WO scenarios.
